<?php

namespace app\controllers;

use amirkhh\filemanager\actions\ListAction;
use amirkhh\filemanager\actions\UploadAction;
use yii\web\Controller;

class SiteController extends Controller
{
    public function actions()
    {
        return [
            'file-list' => [
                'class' => ListAction::class,
            ],
            'file-upload' => [
                'class' => UploadAction::class,
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

### Call widget

Once the extension is installed, simply use it in your code by  :

```php
<?= \amirkhh\filemanager\FileManager::widget(['form' => $form]) ?>
```
